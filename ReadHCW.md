## How Computers work?

What makes a computer, a computer? a computer takes information from you which is the input and then store it and make some processing procedure that indicates a series of commands called an algorithm to let you get the results which are the outputs and These are the main four steps that every machine does it do to work and show you the results.

The language that computers understand is binary or zero one language and every programming language is a method to translate what you want to tell the computer to do to the binary language that indicates a different number system like decimal number system even the texts or audios or videos the translator which the programming languages convert them to binary number system to let the computer understand what should to do.

The circuits are the main factor that helps to translate what do you want the computer do to zero one number system and let you get your expected output to depend on your code which the circuits take your code and divide it into small and simple parts and solve each one individually to create the output.

But how the hardware and the software interact with each other, the main part the responsible about that is the CPU which consists of many of the tiny circuits and each one of the circuits does a specific thing to do the job and convert the input from the hardware to output on the computer screen.
