A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow to achieve a goal each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions, and computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically so to approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.
